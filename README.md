## About BianZhiDai 2.0 ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°

**bianzhidai** is inspired by shading characters in ASCII art and Áºñ Áªá Ë¢ã BiƒÅn Zhƒ´ Da√¨ (woven plastic bag in Simple Chinese). 
Previously constructed in [GDC](http://glyphdrawing.club) 
(glyphdrawingclub, designed and developed by @hlotvonen and @i-tu ), turned into modular when doing the revision. **bianzhidai** is good with colors, especially in combination with different fill/stroke colors. Try it, and play it. Besides, the whole font is modular based, so you can customize it in [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) any way you like.
 
**bianzhidai 2.0** is an updated version, which is intended to provide a stead(ier) structure for the characters, more decorative/playful styles and (slightly) enhanced readbility. With ten styles: Base, Cube, Stitches, Ring, Pearl, Bubble, Messy, Messier, Brush, and Cloud. 
(Hooo, long list...)

Hope you will enjoy it! <3

## Credit (the typeface and its designer) üí°

Crediting the typeface and its designer is crucial, as it shows appreciation for the generosity of designers who are willing to offer their fonts as open-source. It's noticeable that some individuals neglect to credit open-source typefaces and their designers. Acknowledging and appreciating these creative contributions is important. 

ANYWAYS, JUST CREDIT THE TYPEFACE AND DESIGNER, OKAY? <3
