## About BianZhiDai 2.0

**bianzhidai** is inspired by shading characters in ASCII art and 编 织 袋 Biān Zhī Daì (woven plastic bag in Simple Chinese). 
Previously constructed in [GDC](http://glyphdrawing.club) 
(glyphdrawingclub, designed and developed by @hlotvonen and @i-tu ), turned into modular when doing the revision. **bianzhidai** is good with colors, especially in combination with different fill/stroke colors. Try it, and play it. Besides, the whole font is modular based, so you can customize it in [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) any way you like.
 
**bianzhidai 2.0** is an updated version, which is intended to provide a stead(ier) structure for the characters, more decorative/playful styles and (slightly) enhanced readbility. With ten styles: Base, Cube, Stitches, Ring, Pearl, Bubble, Messy, Messier, Brush, and Cloud. 
(Hooo, long list...)

Hope you will enjoy it! <3

## Credit (the typeface and its designer)

Crediting the typeface and its designer is crucial, as it shows appreciation for the generosity of designers who are willing to offer their fonts as open-source. It's noticeable that some individuals neglect to credit open-source typefaces and their designers. Acknowledging and appreciating these creative contributions is important. 

ANYWAYS, JUST CREDIT THE DESIGNER, OKAY? <3
